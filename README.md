# lunar_lander
Final project for CGRA151

## Concept

A modern clone of the classic game Lunar Lander. The player controls a lunar module approaching the moon’s surface, with the goal of landing without crashing or running out of fuel. The moon, however, is steep and treacherous, and the player must find a flat area to land on, without drifting into the side of a hill.

## Gameplay

The player controls the orientation of the module and fires the thruster in order to steer the module to a landing area and land safely. At the top of the screen, the player is given information about the module’s speed, altitude, and fuel, which is consumed by controlling the module. There is a limited amount of fuel, which is consumed by all controls. Whether the player lands safely or crashes, the game starts another round with the player’s remaining fuel. The game ends when the module touches the ground after running out of fuel.

### Controls

- **A**: rotate left
- **D**: rotate right
- **W**: main thruster
